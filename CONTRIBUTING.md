# Contribution Guide

## Code Style

All Python code should be compatible with the latest Python version at the time. [Autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) will be automatically run against your code.

## What to contribute?

- Bug fixes (please look at the issues, if you can't find one for your bug --> create one)
- Security fixes (please don't discuss publicly for obvious reasons, consult one of the maintainers)
- Feature improvements (please create an issue for this with the according label and discuss openly)
- Spelling mistakes and new languages
- Code reworks (please discuss your steps in the pull request comments, i.e. why your code is better now)

## How to contribute?

In most cases the best thing you can do is to create an issue with your contribution and label it accordingly and wait for people to comment on it.

If you feel like the issue is easily fixable for you and the consensus of the issue is positive for your idea, go for it!

- Fork the repository
- Commit your changes with an understandable commit message
- Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository (preferably in the dev branch!)
- Profit!

## Which branch should I push to?

Please consult `README.md` for the branching model.
